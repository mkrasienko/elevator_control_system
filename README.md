# Elevator Control Simulator

This is a elevator control system simulator.

1. The elevator will take 3 states:
  - current floor
  - moving direction
  - target floor
2. A user will be able to give input on each floor
  - going_up
  - going_down

The elevator should be able to queue user inputs and sort them depending on first input and direction of travel.
